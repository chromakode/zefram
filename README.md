Zefram is a simple isomorphic nodejs core. His goals are to be
simple, fast, and legible.

Zefram has few opinions about how you structure your app. He merely provides a
useful abstraction for isomorphic code.

Batteries are not included. You're expected to create your own templates and
integration code (see the examples dir for a starter).

Beware of the borg.
